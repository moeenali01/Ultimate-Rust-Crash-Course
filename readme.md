# Ultimate Rust Crash Course

Welcome to the repository containing all my practice and exercises from the **Ultimate Rust Crash Course** on Udemy. This repository includes my completed projects and exercises throughout the course, which covers the basics of Rust language, tooling, ecosystem, and various advanced concepts like ownership, memory model, concurrency, and more.


## About
This repository showcases my journey through the **Ultimate Rust Crash Course** on Udemy, where I learned the fundamentals of the Rust programming language. This course provided a comprehensive understanding of Rust’s core features, including its memory safety model, ownership system, concurrency, and more. 

By organizing my work here, I hope to share my progress and help others who are learning Rust or are interested in understanding how to apply Rust in systems programming.

## Course Details
The **Ultimate Rust Crash Course** provides a thorough introduction to Rust and its ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of the key topics covered in the course:

- **Rust Language Basics**: Learn the core features of Rust, including variables, scope, functions, and modules.
- **Scalar & Compound Types**: Explore primitive data types like integers, floating-point numbers, and compound types like tuples and arrays.
- **Control Flow**: Understand how to handle conditions and loops (if/else, match, while, for).
- **Strings**: Dive deep into handling strings and understanding Rust's memory model.
- **Structs, Traits, and Enums**: Learn how to create and use structs, enums, and traits for defining complex types and behavior.
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Understand the key concepts of Rust’s ownership model and how it ensures memory safety.
- **Memory Model**: Learn how Rust handles memory management without a garbage collector.
- **Concurrency and Safety**: Explore how Rust allows writing safe and concurrent programs with minimal runtime overhead.

Additionally, the course includes **fun tips and tricks** to enhance your programming style and improve efficiency when using Rust for systems programming.
